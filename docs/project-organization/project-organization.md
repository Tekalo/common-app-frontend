# Project Organization

Configuration folders and files are at the root of the project and everything concerning the actual app is contained in the `src` directory.

In general, this project conforms to a standard Next.js project structure. We do not currently make use of the experimental App directory that Next.js 13 provides due to restrictions in our deployment environment (Cloudflare Pages).

- [configuration files](./configuration-files.md)
